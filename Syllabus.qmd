## Course Description

This course in an introduction to data management, data visualization and statistical inference that is intended for early-stage graduate students with no background in statistics. The primary objective of the course is to get students up to speed with respect to organization, manipulation, visualization, and analysis of data, using the R statistical language. Students will learn to organize and analyze data sets in the form of RStudio projects, using R Markdown files to reproducibly capture and render code, visualizations and analyses. This is a practical course with a foundation of conceptual intuition with the goal of enabling students to analyze their own data sets with confidence using reasonable approaches, and to provide a foundation for more advanced courses in statistics, data science and machine learning. The course is designed to primarily on univariate (single response variable) analysis. For students interested in multivariate analysis, other courses in Department of Data Science will be available. Examples and assignments in class will largely be drawn from the life sciences in general, and bioengineering in particular. For learning outcomes, and specific topics covered in class, please see the course goals below and the schedule on the 'Syllabus' page of this website.

## Course Structure

We will hold on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 4:00PM to 5:50PM. These meetings will be relatively informal, and will usually begin with a 20-30 min. review of the most salient topics from the course book, possibly including some R coding demonstrations. I will post all lecture slides as Markdown and HTML after class to the course website under the 'Lectures' tab. The remaining meeting time will be reserved for questions, answers, and discussion (similar to a "recitation", or additional "office hours"). I encourage students to work on exercises and assignments during these periods so that questions can be directly addressed as they emerge.

#### *Graded Assignments*

**Problem sets:** Students will be assigned four problem sets (roughly one every 2 weeks) to complete independently. These will mostly focus on one or a few data sets each, and the goal will be for the students to organize, visualize, analyze, and interpret the data sets in light of specific scientific motivations. - 80% of grade.

**Term project:** Students will choose to analyze a dataset of their choice from their own research. The goal of this project is allow students agency in applying what they are learning in class to their own data, and to format the results in an appropriate Rmarkdown or Quarto format that can form the nucleus of a subsequent publication - 20% of grade.

**Preparing and submitting assignments:** The information required to complete all in-class assignments and problem sets will be given in instructions on Canvas. Students should carefully follow the detailed instructions associated with each assignment. Students are encouraged to work together and share information. In particular, some students will have a higher skill level than others, and we encourage those students with more experience to help their peers. *However, no direct sharing of code is allowed – each student must write their own code.*

**Preparing and submitting assignments:** Assignments will be submitted on Canvas in the form of R Markdown files, with the rendered html output. Be sure to include your name on the document. Be professional – appropriately name your files, make sure they are organized, and submit only the information requested. Late assignments will not be accepted.
