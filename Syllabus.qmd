## Course Description

This course in an introduction to data management, data visualization and statistical inference that is intended for early-stage bioengineering and bioscience graduate students with no background in statistics. This is a practical course with a foundation of conceptual intuition matched with hands-on coding each week. The primary objective of the course is to provide foundational training in the organization, manipulation, visualization, and analysis of data, using the R statistical language in a reproducible manner. After this course students will be able to analyze their own data sets with confidence using reasonable approaches, and to provide a foundation for more advanced courses in statistics, data science and machine learning. The course is designed to primarily for the analysis of univariate (single response variable) data. For students interested in multivariate analysis, other courses in Department of Data Science are available. Examples and assignments in class will largely be drawn from bioengineering and the life sciences.

## Course Structure

We will hold on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 4:00PM to 5:50PM. These meetings will be relatively informal, and will usually begin with a 30-45 min. conceptual overview of topics with R coding demonstrations. I will post all lecture slides as Markdown and HTML after class to the course website under the 'Lectures' tab. The remaining meeting time will be reserved for group work, questions, answers, and discussion (similar to a "recitation", or additional "office hours"). I encourage students to work on exercises and assignments during these periods so that questions can be directly addressed as they emerge.

## Course Objectives

-   *Scientific Computing Fundamentals*
    -   Describe fundamental aspects of computer systems, including file types, storage structure, and the logic of programming languages.
    -   Read and write code in Unix.
    -   Read and write code in R using RStudio.
    -   Properly organize and format primary data and metadata files for analysis
    -   Learn programming fundamentals of the R statistical language, including objects, functions, iteration, and simulation.
    -   Articulate the importance of and requirements for reproducible science in bioinformatics.
    -   Utilize the UO’s supercomputer cluster, Talapas, for computationally intensive tasks.
-   *Probability and Exploratory Data Analysis*
    -   Describe the history of data analysis and statistics, particularly its eugenics origins.
    -   Explain probability in the context of distributions and sampling.
    -   Describe the meaning of p-values, test statistics, and types of errors.
-   *Statistical Visualization*
    -   Produce well-designed and informative figures in RStudio.
    -   Make publication-quality data visualizations, including scatterplots, boxplots, frequency distributions, mosaic plots, etc.
-   *Point Estimation*
    -   Parameters and statistics
    -   Confidence intervals
    -   Statistical distributions
    -   T-statistics
-   *Experimental Design and Linear Models*
    -   Design experiments and clinical trials to produce the necessary types of data required to answer a given scientific question.
    -   Understand Type I and Type II statistical error, including p-values and power analysis.
    -   Understand ordinary least-squares regression and linear models in general
    -   Learn to apply general linear models to basic univariate analysis problems,including Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)
-   *Application of Linear Models to Machine Learning*
    -   Examining linear models as classical machine learning
    -   Prediction and estimation
    -   Shrinkage and regularization
    -   Cross-validation
-   *Nonparameteric Statistics*
    -   Learn nonparametric approaches to parameter estimate and statistical inference,
    -   including resampling (bootstrapping), permutation, and rank-based analysis.
    -   Understand how to analyze binary response variables and frequency-based (e.g. contingency table) data sets.

## Graded Assignments

**Problem sets:** Students will be assigned four problem sets (roughly one every 2 weeks) to complete independently. These will mostly focus on one or a few data sets each, and the goal will be for the students to organize, visualize, analyze, and interpret the data sets in light of specific scientific motivations. - 80% of grade.

**Term project:** Students will choose to analyze a dataset of their choice from their own research. The goal of this project is allow students agency in applying what they are learning in class to their own data, and to format the results in an appropriate Rmarkdown or Quarto document that can form the nucleus of a subsequent publication - 20% of grade.

**Preparing and submitting assignments:** The information required to complete all in-class assignments and problem sets will be given in instructions on Canvas. Students should carefully follow the detailed instructions associated with each assignment. Students are encouraged to work together and share information. In particular, some students will have a higher skill level than others, and we encourage those students with more experience to help their peers. *However, no direct sharing of code is allowed.*

**Preparing and submitting assignments:** Assignments will be submitted on Canvas in the form of Quarto files, with the rendered html output. Be sure to include your name on the document. Be professional – appropriately name your files, make sure they are organized, and submit only the information requested. Late assignments will not be accepted.
