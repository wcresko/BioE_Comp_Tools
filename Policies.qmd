### Workload expectations

-   This is a 4-credit hour course, so you should expect to complete 120 hours of work for the course—an average of about 12 hours each week (this includes time in-class).

-   My estimate for time usage for activities and assignments in an average week is below – some weeks may have shorter or longer time commitments either by design or due to course scheduling.

    | Activity                                      | Hours per Week |
    |-----------------------------------------------|:--------------:|
    | In-class meetings                             |      3-4       |
    | Pre-class reading                             |       4        |
    | Informal exercises                            |       1        |
    | Homework assignments                          |       2        |
    | Research, drafting, editing for final project |       1        |
    | TOTAL                                         |       12       |

-   I encourage working ahead of due dates. Reading a chapter or two each day is much easier than trying to finish a novel just before class. Doing a few hours of work each week on your mid-term paper is much easier than staying up all night before the day it is due. I hope these time estimates help you plan for success.

### Communication

-   Our class will communicate through our Canvas site. Announcements and emails are archived there, automatically forwarded to your UO email, and can even reach you by text. Check and adjust your settings under Account \> Notifications.
-   We will also be using the GitHub Pages website for the course as the repository for lecture schedule, syllabus, lecture slides and other materials.
-   Every Monday I will post an Announcement that previews critical concepts we’ll work on that week and a checklist of the week’s due dates. You can also find this information in the overview page in each Canvas module.
-   I get in touch with individual students when needed through email, and I try to respond to questions within one business day.
-   When giving feedback on assignments, I do so in Canvas, and turnaround time for feedback is generally one weekWhy should you communicate with me? I enjoy talking with students about our course material! Are you confused or excited about something? Wondering how what we’re learning relates to current events, career choices, or other classes you can take UO? Please be in touch! Please also be in touch to tell me how you are doing in the course. If you are having trouble with some aspect of it, I would like to strategize with you. I believe every student can succeed in this course, and I care about your success.
-   Office hour details When & where: I will host office hours each week on \[day/time\] and at \[location\]. I welcome meetings outside my regular office hours as well. Just email me or call me at \[office number\] to set a time.
-   During office hours, students bring in a wide range of concerns, questions, and successes. We might talk through a specific concept or problem to clarify it, might think together about an issue a student is curious about that relates to the class, might discuss a student’s post-graduation goals, might identify more supportive methods to study for a future exam or to begin a project, or any number of other topics. Some students have never been to an instructor’s office hours—if that is you, please change that this term by attending! Feel free to come with a peer if that is useful for you.

### Classroom Community Expectations

-   All members of the class (both students and instructor) can expect to:

#### *Participate and Contribute*: 
All students are expected to participate by sharing ideas and contributing to the learning environment. This entails preparing, following instructions, and engaging respectfully and thoughtfully with others. While all students should participate, participation is not just talking, and a range of participation activities support learning. Participation might look like speaking aloud in the full class and in small groups as well as submitting questions prior to class or engaging with Discussion posts. We will establish more specific participation guidelines and criteria for contributions in our first weeks of the term.

#### *Expect and Respect Diversity*
All classes at the University of Oregon welcome and respect diverse experiences, perspectives, and approaches.What is not welcome are behaviors or contributions that undermine, demean, or marginalize others based on race, ethnicity, gender, sex, age, sexual orientation, religion, ability, or socioeconomic status. We will value differences and communicate disagreements with respect. We may establish more specific guidelines and protocols to ensure inclusion and equity for all members of our learning community.

#### *Help Everyone Learn*
Part of how we learn together is by learning from one another. To do this effectively, we need to be patient with each other, identify ways we can assist others, and be open-minded to receiving help and feedback from others. Don’t hesitate to contact me to ask for assistance or offer suggestions that might help us learn better.


### Generative Artificial Intelligence Use

Students can use GenAI tools in this class to help with certain aspects of course work and assignments. This includes brainstorming ideas, creating a paper outline, or summarizing research findings of articles. However, you cannot use content such as text or graphics created by GenAI tools in your work; rather, you must be the author/creator of your work submissions. For example, you can use a GenAI tool to suggest a paper outline based on a draft you provide it, but you cannot submit a paper with text generated by GenAI as if the text is your own writing. Be advised, in accordance with UO policy, if I believe you’ve handed in work created whole or in part by GenAI tools, I may submit a report of suspected academic misconduct to the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards for that office to make a determination of responsibility and, if warranted, assess a grade penalty. So, if you are in doubt or have questions about a particular GenAI tool and if its use is okay, check in with me and let’s discuss!
