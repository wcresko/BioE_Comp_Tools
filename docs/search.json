The primary objective of the course is to get students up to speed with respect to organization, manipulation, visualization, and analysis of data, using the R statistical language. Students will learn to organize and analyze data sets in the form of RStudio projects, using R Markdown files to reproducibly capture and render code, visualizations and analyses. This is a practical course with a foundation of conceptual intuition with the goal of enabling students to analyze their own data sets with confidence using reasonable approaches, and to provide a foundation for more advanced courses in statistics, data science and machine learning. The course is designed to primarily on univariate (single response variable) analysis. For students interested in multivariate analysis, other courses in Department of Data Science will be available. Examples and assignments in class will largely be drawn from the life sciences in general, and bioengineering in particular. For learning outcomes, and specific topics covered in class, please see the course goals below and the schedule on the ‘Syllabus’ page of this website."

These will mostly focus on one or a few data sets each, and the goal will be for the students to organize, visualize, analyze, and interpret the data sets in light of specific scientific motivations. - 80% of grade.\nTerm project: Students will choose to analyze a dataset of their choice from their own research. The goal of this project is allow students agency in applying what they are learning in class to their own data, and to format the results in an appropriate Rmarkdown or Quarto document that can form the nucleus of a subsequent publication - 20% of grade.\nPreparing and submitting assignments: The information required to complete all in-class assignments and problem sets will be given in instructions on Canvas. Students should carefully follow the detailed instructions associated with each assignment. Students are encouraged to work together and share information. In particular, some students will have a higher skill level than others, and we encourage those students with more experience to help their peers. However, no direct sharing of code is allowed.\nPreparing and submitting assignments: Assignments will be submitted on Canvas in the form of Quarto files, with the rendered html output. Be sure to include your name on the document. Be professional – appropriately name your files, make sure they are organized, and submit only the information requested.

Announcements and emails are archived there, automatically forwarded to your UO email, and can even reach you by text. Check and adjust your settings under Account &gt; Notifications.\nWe will also be using this GitHub Pages website (https://wcresko.github.io/BioE_Stats/) for the course as the repository for lecture schedule, syllabus, lecture slides and other materials.\nEvery Monday I will post an Announcement that previews critical concepts we’ll work on that week and a checklist of the week’s due dates.\nI will contact individual students when needed through email, and I try to respond to questions within one business day.\nWhen giving feedback on assignments, I do so in Canvas, and turnaround time for feedback is generally one week.\n\n\n\nOffice hours\n\nI will host office hours each week on Monday and from 3:30 to 4:30. The end of many class periods will also function as a form of office hour.\nI welcome meetings outside my regular office hours as well - please email me to set a time.\nDuring office hours, students bring in a wide range of concerns, questions, and successes. We might\n\ntalk through a specific concept or problem to clarify it\nthink together about an issue a student is curious about that relates to the class\ndiscuss a student’s post-graduation goals\nidentify more supportive methods to study for a future exam or to begin a project\nor any number of other topics"

    "text": "Classroom Community Expectations\n\nParticipate and Contribute:\nAll students are expected to participate by sharing ideas and contributing to the learning environment. This entails preparing, following instructions, and engaging respectfully and thoughtfully with others. While all students should participate, participation is not just talking, and a range of participation activities support learning. Participation might look like speaking aloud in the full class and in small groups, and working collaboratively on coding projects. We will establish more specific participation guidelines and criteria for contributions in our first weeks of the term.\n\n\nExpect and Respect Diversity\nAll classes at the University of Oregon welcome and respect diverse experiences, perspectives, and approaches. What is not welcome are behaviors or contributions that undermine, demean, or marginalize others based on race, ethnicity, gender, sex, age, sexual orientation, religion, ability, or socioeconomic status. We will value differences and communicate disagreements with respect. We may establish more specific guidelines and protocols to ensure inclusion and equity for all members of our learning community.\n\n\nHelp Everyone Learn\nPart of how we learn together is by learning from one another. To do this effectively, we need to be patient with each other, identify ways we can assist others, and be open-minded to receiving help and feedback from others. Don’t hesitate to contact me to ask for assistance or offer suggestions that might help us learn better."

We will discuss during the first week how GenAI can be a tool to help you, but it cannot replace your statistical intuition and knowledge. However, you cannot use content such as text, graphics and code created by GenAI tools in your work. You must be the author/creator of your work submissions. For example, you can use a GenAI tool to suggest a paper outline based on a draft you provide it, or suggest some code, but you cannot submit a paper with text or code generated by GenAI as if the text or code is your own writing. If you are in doubt or have questions about a particular GenAI tool and if its use is okay, check in with me and let’s discuss!"

Putting this result vector of indices within the square brackets allows us to subset the data.frame based on these indices (specifically, we are subsetting specific rows of data).\nIn the second example, we want to see all data that was recorded prior to 1960.

    "text": "piping\nAlright. So before we discussed joins, we were describing the different main verbs of dplyr. We discussed rename, select, mutate, group_by, and summarise. A final point, and something tidyverse folks really love, is the use of these functions in nested statements through the use of piping.\nPipes in bash scripting look like |, pipes in R syntax look like %&gt;%. It does not matter what it looks like though, it matter what it does. Here is a simple example of the use of piping. We can go back to the example of calculating the mean life expectancy per country from the gapminder data.\nThe usual way\n\ntmp &lt;- dplyr::group_by(dat, country)\ntmp2 &lt;- dplyr::summarise(tmp, mnLifeExp=mean(lifeExp))\n\nThe piped way\n\ntmp3 &lt;- dat %&gt;%\n    dplyr::group_by(country) %&gt;%\n    dplyr::summarise(mnLifeExp=mean(lifeExp))\n\nThe results of these two are identical (all(tmp3==tmp2) returns TRUE).\nThis is useful, as commands can be chained together, including the creation of new variables, subsetting and summarising of existing variables, etc. One thing to keep in mind is to check intermediate results – instead of just piping all the way through – as data manipulation errors can be introduced mid-statement and go unnoticed. That is, in some situations, piping does not help reproducibility. Many proponents argue that it helps with code readability, while many others say that actively makes code less human readable. It definitely does require adopting a certain syntax and the assumption that every end user is on the tidyverse train, which is not ideal when reproducibility involves everyone, not just the cool tidy/Hadley/RStudio crowd."
