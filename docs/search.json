Participation might look like speaking aloud in the full class and in small groups, and working collaboratively on coding projects. We will establish more specific participation guidelines and criteria for contributions in our first weeks of the term.\n\n\nExpect and Respect Diversity\nAll classes at the University of Oregon welcome and respect diverse experiences, perspectives, and approaches. What is not welcome are behaviors or contributions that undermine, demean, or marginalize others based on race, ethnicity, gender, sex, age, sexual orientation, religion, ability, or socioeconomic status. We will value differences and communicate disagreements with respect. We may establish more specific guidelines and protocols to ensure inclusion and equity for all members of our learning community.\n\n\nHelp Everyone Learn\nPart of how we learn together is by learning from one another. To do this effectively, we need to be patient with each other, identify ways we can assist others, and be open-minded to receiving help and feedback from others. Don’t hesitate to contact me to ask for assistance or offer suggestions that might help us learn better."

For example, you can use a GenAI tool to suggest a paper outline based on a draft you provide it, or suggest some code, but you cannot submit a paper with text or code generated by GenAI as if the text or code is your own writing.
