## Directions

**Assignment:** Your task is to use R and Quarto Markdown to write a short report including the following tasks. You will use a new data set studying the **predictive ability of different (`knee_injury.csv`)** which is a synthetic data set of various measurements and whether the participant developed a knee injury.

In addition, perform at least one of these statistical analyses on **the dataset that you've identified for your term long project** depending on the nature of your data.

**Due:** Submit your work via Canvas by the end of the day (midnight) on **Wednesday, June 11th.** Please submit **both the Quarto_md file *and* the resulting html or pdf file**. You can work with other members of class, but I expect each of you to construct and run all of the scripts yourself.

## Problem 4.1 : Logistic regression analysis of injury risk

## The Study

Knee injuries are common among individuals who engage in physical activity. Understanding the risk factors contributing to such injuries is essential for developing preventative strategies. In this assignment, you will use logistic regression to model the probability of experiencing a knee injury based on physiological and lifestyle variables.

**Dataset Description:** You have been provided with a dataset (available on Canvas) containing 300 synthetic observations with the following variables:

-   `knee_injury`: Binary response variable (1 = injury occurred, 0 = no injury)

-   `age`: Age of the individual in years

-   `fitness_level`: Composite fitness score (0–100 scale)

-   `exercise_hours_per_week`: Average number of hours of physical activity per week

-   `metabolic_marker`: A standardized metabolic biomarker level (unitless)

-   `bmi`: Body Mass Index

-   `muscle_strength`: a measurement of maximum resistance

-   `flexibility score`: a scaled integrative measurement of various stretching tests

-   `previous injury`: whether the participant had a similar previous injury

-   `balance score`: a summary score of how well the individual balances on one leg

**Tasks:**

1.  **Exploratory Data Analysis**

    -   Summarize the distribution of each variable.

    -   Visualize relationships between each predictor and the injury outcome.

2.  **Model Building**

    -   Fit a logistic regression model to predict `knee_injury` using the other variables.

    -   Interpret the coefficients, especially in terms of odds ratios.

3.  **Model Evaluation**

    -   Assess model performance using appropriate metrics (e.g. confusion matrix).

## Problem 4.2 : Random forest analysis of injury risk

Now you're going to analyze the exact same data set using a random forest classifier using the following steps.

### **Tasks**

1.  **Data Preparation**

    -   Load the dataset in R.

    -   Inspect the variables and perform any necessary preprocessing (e.g., scaling, handling missing values if present).

2.  **Model Fitting**

    -   Use the `randomForest` package to fit a random forest model predicting `knee_injury`.

3.  **Model Interpretation**

    -   Report model accuracy, confusion matrix, and OOB (out-of-bag) error estimate.

    -   Plot and interpret variable importance

    -   Identify which variables were most useful in predicting injury risk.

4.  **Model Evaluation**

    -   Use ROC analysis (`pROC` or `caret` packages) to evaluate model performance.

    -   Analyze performance using LOOCV and K-fold CV.

5.  **Compare results to a logistic regression model**
