# Analysis of Variance

## An Example - Irises

```{r, echo=TRUE, out.width="80%"}
stripchart(iris$Sepal.Length ~ iris$Species, vertical=T, method="jitter",
           ylab="sepal length", xlab="species", pch=19, cex=0.5)
```

## ANOVAs and Hypotheses {.smaller}

$$ H_0: \mu(\text{versicolor_length"}) = \mu(\text{setosa_length}) = \mu(\text{virginica_length})  $$\

$$ H_a: \mu(\text{versicolor_length"}) \neq \mu(\text{setosa_length}) \neq \mu(\text{virginica_length}) $$

## ANOVA \| similar to regression {.vcenter .flexbox}

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/images_5b.016.jpeg")
```

## ANOVA {.vcenter .flexbox}

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/images_5b.015.jpeg")
```

## Assumptions of ANOVA

1.  The response variable (y) is approximately normal in all groups (factor levels)

    -   Deviation from normality O.K. if sample sizes and variances across groups are approximately equal
    -   Most statisticians think that this is within a factor of 2 or 3

2.  Variances equal across groups

3.  Observations within a group are independent

    -   randomly sampled

    -   no structuring of the sampling (but we'll handle this later)

## Differences in Iris sepal length

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
iris_aov <- aov(Sepal.Length ~ Species, iris)
anova(iris_aov)
```

-   Would report this as

$$F_{2, 147} = 119.26; p <2.2*10^{-16}$$

## Means estimates using `lm` {.smaller}

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
summary(lm(iris$Sepal.Length ~ iris$Species))
```

# Testing what levels of a factor variable differ from one another

## Means for greater than two factor levels? {.smaller}

-   The F-ratio test for a single-factor ANOVA tests for any difference among groups.
-   If we want to understand specific differences, we need further “contrasts”.
-   Unplanned comparisons (post hoc):
    -   Multiple comparisons carried out after the results are obtained.
    -   Used to find which means differ from which other means
    -   Comparisons require protection for inflated Type 1 error rates:
-   Planned comparisons (*a priori*):
    -   Comparisons between group means that were decided when the experiment was designed (not after the data were in)
    -   Must be few in number to avoid inflating Type 1 error rates

## *Post Hoc* Comparisons {.smaller}

-   Say you start your experiment with no idea of how groups would differ.
-   So now you've got a significant result that says your groups are different from one another!
-   But **how** are they different?
    -   2 groups could be the same and 1 is different,
    -   or all 3 could be different from each other!
-   There are several ways to compare groups after an ANOVA
-   One of the most common ways is by Tukey's tests
    -   Tukey's honestly significant difference (HSD) test (all pairs)
    -   Scheffé contrasts (all combinations of means)
-   The function `TukeyHSD()` in R

## Irises

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
iris_aov <- aov(Sepal.Length ~ Species, iris)
TukeyHSD(iris_aov)
```

## Irises

```{r, echo=F, eval=TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(iris, aes(x = Species, y = Sepal.Length)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "lightblue", color = "black") +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.2, alpha = 0.5) +
  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = "point", shape = 20, size = 3, color = "red") +
  labs(
    title = "Box Plot by Category",
    x = "Species",
    y = "Sepal Length"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Irises

```{r, echo=T, eval=F}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(iris, aes(x = Species, y = Sepal.Length)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "lightblue", color = "black") +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.2, alpha = 0.5) +
  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = "point", shape = 20, size = 3, color = "red") +
  labs(
    title = "Box Plot by Category",
    x = "Species",
    y = "Sepal Length"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Biomarker Data {.smaller}

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}

biomarker_data <-read.table("biomarkers.tsv", header=T, sep="\t")
biomarker_anova <- aov(marker5 ~ diagnosis, biomarker_data)
anova(biomarker_anova)
```

## Biomarker Data {.smaller}

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
biomarker_data <-read.table("biomarkers.tsv", header=T, sep="\t")
biomarker_anova <- aov(marker5 ~ diagnosis, biomarker_data)
TukeyHSD(biomarker_anova)
```

## Biomarker Data

```{r, echo=F, eval=TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(biomarker_data, aes(x = diagnosis, y = marker5)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "lightblue", color = "black") +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.2, alpha = 0.5) +
  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = "point", shape = 20, size = 3, color = "red") +
  labs(
    title = "Box Plot by Category",
    x = "Category",
    y = "Value"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

```

## Biomarker Data {.smaller}

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
biomarker_data <-read.table("biomarkers.tsv", header=T, sep="\t")
biomarker_anova <- aov(marker5 ~ diagnosis, biomarker_data)
summary(lm(marker5 ~ diagnosis, biomarker_data))
```

## Let's practice - using the categorical predictor variables in the stickleback data set

-   Read in the data as before
-   Pick one categorical predictor variable to include
-   Make sure that R sees them as type `factor`
-   Set up the model and evaluate the overall fit
-   Do a post-hoc means test with Tukey's HSD

## Fitting the model

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}

stickle_micro <-read.table("Stickle_RNAseq.tsv", header=T, sep="\t")
  
stickle_micro_anova <- aov(Gene42 ~ Geno.Micro, stickle_micro)
anova(stickle_micro_anova)
```

## Tukey's posthoc

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
TukeyHSD(stickle_micro_anova)
```

## Plot of the different levels

```{r, echo=F, eval=TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(stickle_micro, aes(x = Geno.Micro, y = Gene42)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "lightblue", color = "black") +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.2, alpha = 0.5) +
  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = "point", shape = 20, size = 3, color = "red") +
  labs(
    title = "Box Plot by Category",
    x = "treatment category",
    y = "Value"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

```

# Planned (*a priori*) contrasts

## Planned (*a priori*) contrasts {.smaller}

-   A well planned experiment often dictates which comparison of means are of most interest, whereas other comparisons are of no interest.
-   By restricting the comparisons to just those of interest, researchers can mitigate the multiple testing problem associated with *post-hoc* tests.
-   Some statisticians argue that, in fact, planned comparisons allow researchers to avoid adjusting p-values all together because each test is therefore unique.
-   Contrasts can also allow more complicated tests of the relationships among means.
-   Coding *a priori* contrasts in `R` is quite easy and just depends upon writing the right series of coefficient contrasts.

## Planned (a priori) contrasts {.flexbox .vcenter}

|          Null Hypothesis          | Group_1 | Group_2 | Group_3 | Group_4 |
|:---------------------------------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|
|          $\mu_1 =\mu_2$           |    1    |   -1    |    0    |    0    |
|          $\mu_1 =\mu_3$           |    1    |    0    |   -1    |    0    |
|          $\mu_3 =\mu_4$           |    0    |    0    |   -1    |    1    |
| $\frac{(\mu_1+\mu_2)}{2} = \mu_3$ |   0.5   |   0.5   |   -1    |    0    |

## R INTERLUDE \| Planned contrasts {.smaller}

```{r, eval=F, echo=TRUE}
RNAseq_Data <- read.table("Stickle_RNAseq.tsv", header=T, sep='')

RNAseq_Data$Geno.Micro <- factor(RNAseq_Data$Geno.Micro)

contrast_matrix <- matrix(c(
  -1, 1, 0, 0,
  -1, 0, 1, 0
), ncol = 2)

colnames(contrast_matrix) <- c("level1_vs_level2", "level1_vs_level3")
rownames(contrast_matrix) <- levels(RNAseq_Data$Geno.Micro)

contrasts(RNAseq_Data$Geno.Micro) <- contrast_matrix

RNA_model <- aov(Gene10 ~ Geno.Micro, data = RNAseq_Data)
summary.lm(RNA_model)

# Fixed vs. Random Effects in ANOVA

## ANOVA \| Fixed effects of factors {.smaller}

-   Groups are predetermined, of direct interest, repeatable.
-   For example:
    -   medical treatments in a clinical trial
    -   predetermined doses of a toxin
    -   age groups in a population
    -   habitat, season, etc.
-   Any conclusions reached in the study about differences among groups can be applied only to the groups included in the study.
-   The results cannot be generalized to other treatments, habitats, etc. not included in the study.

## ANOVA \| Random effects of factors {.smaller}

-   Measurements that come in groups. A group can be:
    -   a family made up of siblings
    -   a subject measured repeatedly
    -   a transect of quadrats in a sampling survey
    -   a block of an experiment done at a given time
-   Groups are assumed to be randomly sampled from a population of groups.
-   Therefore, conclusions reached about groups can be generalized to the population of groups.
-   With random effects, the variance among groups is the main quantity of interest, not the specific group attributes.

## ANOVA \| Random effects of factors {.smaller}

-   Whenever your sampling design is nested
-   Whenever you divide up plots and apply separate treatments to subplots
-   Whenever your replicates are grouped spatially or temporally
    -   in blocks
    -   in batches
-   Whenever you take measurements on related individuals
-   Whenever you measure subjects or other sampling units repeatedly

## ANOVA \| Random effects of factors

$$ H_0: \sigma^2_\alpha=0$$ $$ H_A: \sigma^2_\alpha \neq 0$$

## ANOVA \| Caution about fixed vs. random effects

-   Using fixed vs. random effects changes the way that statistical tests are performed in ANOVA
-   Most statistical packages assume that all factors are fixed unless you instruct it otherwise
-   Designating factors as random takes extra work and probably a read of the manual
-   In `R`, `lm` assumes that all effects are fixed
-   For random effects, use `lme` instead (part of the nlme package)

## ANOVA \| R interlude

-   Set up an analysis of the stickleback data but with the factor as a random effect

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
library(nlme)
RNAseq_Data <- read.table("Stickle_RNAseq.tsv", header=T, sep='')

RNAseq_Data$Geno.Micro <- factor(RNAseq_Data$Geno.Micro)

micro_model_random_effect <- lme(fixed = Gene202 ~ 1,
                                 random = ~1 | Geno.Micro,
                                 data = stickle_micro)

summary(micro_model_random_effect)

```

## ANOVA \| R interlude {.smaller}

```{r, echo=F, eval=TRUE}
library(nlme)
RNAseq_Data <- read.table("Stickle_RNAseq.tsv", header=T, sep='')

RNAseq_Data$Geno.Micro <- factor(RNAseq_Data$Geno.Micro)

micro_model_random_effect <- lme(fixed = Gene202 ~ 1,
                                 random = ~1 | Geno.Micro,
                                 data = stickle_micro)

summary(micro_model_random_effect)

```

# How to present your statistical results

## Style of a results section {.smaller}

-   Write the text of the `Result`s section concisely and objectively.
-   The passive voice will likely dominate here, but use the active voice as much as possible.
-   Use the past tense.
-   Avoid repetitive paragraph structures.
-   Do not interpret the data here.

## Function of a results section {.smaller}

-   The function is to objectively present your key results, without interpretation, in an orderly and logical sequence using both text and illustrative materials (Tables and Figures).

-   The results section always begins with text, reporting the key results and referring to figures and tables as you proceed.

-   The text of the Results section should be crafted to follow this sequence and highlight the evidence needed to answer the questions/hypotheses you investigated.

-   Important negative results should be reported, too.

-   Authors usually write the text of the results section based upon the sequence of Tables and Figures.

## Summaries of the statistical analyses {.smaller}

-   May appear either in the text (usually parenthetically) or in the relevant Tables or Figures (in the legend or as footnotes to the Table or Figure).

-   Each Table and Figure must be referenced in the text portion of the results, and you must tell the reader what the key result(s) is that each Table or Figure conveys.

-   Tables and Figures are assigned numbers separately and in the sequence that you will refer to them from the text.

    -   The first Table you refer to is Table 1, the next Table 2 and so forth.
    -   Similarly, the first Figure is Figure 1, the next Figure 2, etc.

-   Each Table or Figure must include a brief description of the results being presented and other necessary information in a legend.

    -   Table legends go above the Table; tables are read from top to bottom.
    -   Figure legends go below the figure; figures are usually viewed from bottom to top.

-   When referring to a Figure from the text, "Figure" is abbreviated as Fig.,e.g., (Fig. 1. Table is never abbreviated, e.g., Table 1.

## Example {.smaller}

-   For example, suppose you asked the question, "Is the average height of male students the same as female students in a pool of randomly selected Biology majors?"
-   You would first collect height data from large random samples of male and female students.
-   You would then calculate the descriptive statistics for those samples (mean, SD, n, range, etc) and plot these numbers.
-   Suppose you found that male Biology majors are, on average, 12.5 cm taller than female majors; this is the answer to the question.
-   Notice that the outcome of a statistical analysis itself is not a key result, but rather an analytical tool that helps us understand what is our key result.

## Differences, directionality, and magnitude {.smaller}

-   Report your results so as to provide as much information as possible to the reader about the nature of differences or relationships.

-   For example, if you are testing for differences among groups, and you find a significant difference, it is not sufficient to simply report that "groups A and B were significantly different". How are they different? How much are they different?

-   It is much more informative to say something like, "Group A individuals were 23% larger than those in Group B", or, "Group B pups gained weight at twice the rate of Group A pups."

-   Report the direction of differences (greater, larger, smaller, etc) and the magnitude of differences (% difference, how many times, etc.) whenever possible.

## Statistical results in text {.smaller}

-   Statistical test summaries (test name, p-value) are usually reported parenthetically in conjunction with the biological results they support. This parenthetical reference should include the statistical test used, the value, degrees of freedom and the level of significance.

-   For example, if you found that the mean height of male Biology majors was significantly larger than that of female Biology majors, you might report this result (in blue) and your statistical conclusion (shown in red) as follows:

    -   "Males (180.5 ± 5.1 cm; n=34) averaged 12.5 cm taller than females (168 ± 7.6 cm; n=34) in the pool of Biology majors (two-sample t-test, t = 5.78, 33 d.f., p \< 0.001).”

-   If the summary statistics are shown in a figure, the sentence above need not report them specifically, but must include a reference to the figure where they may be seen:

    -   "Males averaged 12.5 cm taller than females in the pool of Biology majors (two-sample t-test, t = 5.78, 33 d.f., p \< 0.001; Fig. 1)."

## Statistical results in text {.smaller}

-   Always enter the appropriate units when reporting data or summary statistics.
    -   for an individual value you would write, "the mean length was 10 cm", or, "the maximum time was 140 min."
    -   When including a measure of variability, place the unit after the error value, e.g., "...was 10 ± 2.3 m".
    -   Likewise place the unit after the last in a series of numbers all having the same unit. For example: "lengths of 5, 10, 15, and 20 m", or "no differences were observed after 2, 4, 6, or 8 min. of incubation".
